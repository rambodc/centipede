# Centipede

Welcome to the Centipede Project's GitHub Repository! Centipede is a highly scalable 3D WebGL web application that harnesses the power of the XRPLedger to enable the development of various decentralized applications.

At present, Centipede offers an array of features, such as a digital wallet, escrow services, token issuance, NFTs, and seamless XRP-to-XRP and token-to-token payment capabilities. Our team is currently working on enhancing Centipede's social aspects by incorporating functionalities like contacts, messaging, and video sharing, providing users with a personalized experience.

Furthermore, we are designing CBDC use cases that will be integrated into the system at a later stage. The XRP Ledger serves as the backbone of our entire platform, ensuring its robustness and reliability. We welcome and appreciate any feedback from the community. 

Centipede was developed using the following technologies:

**WebGL**: A JavaScript API that renders interactive 2D and 3D graphics within any compatible web browser.

**JavaScript**: The primary programming language used to create interactive features and manage the user interface, enabling object creation and manipulation, user input handling, and interaction with the WebGL API.

**HTML5**: Structures content, layout, and multimedia elements, such as audio and video.

**CSS**: Styles and formats the user interface of the platform.

**Web APIs**: Implements various web APIs, like Web Audio API and WebVR API, to provide additional functionality such as audio processing and virtual reality support for the Metaverse.

**Cables**: A visual programming environment for creating interactive 3D graphics.

**Cloud Functions**: Handles email sending with document information and creates resized versions of images uploaded to Cloud Storage.

**Firebase Authentication**: Provides secure user authentication, enabling seamless sign-up and sign-in experiences.

**Firestore Database**: A NoSQL cloud database for storing and syncing data, allowing for real-time updates and offline access.

**Cloud Storage**: Stores user-generated files like images, videos, and other assets.

**Firebase Hosting**: Delivers fast and secure web hosting for the Centipede application.

**Security Rules**: Ensures Centipede remains highly secure while maintaining scalability through well-designed security rules.

**XRP Ledger Javascript Library**: Facilitates interaction with the XRP Ledger, enabling seamless integration of XRP-based features.

**Ammo Physics Library**: Provides a 3D physics engine, enabling realistic physics simulations in the Metaverse.
