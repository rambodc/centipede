# Centipede

Welcome to the Centipede Project's GitHub Repository! Centipede is a highly scalable 3D WebGL web application that harnesses the power of the XRPLedger to enable the development of various decentralized applications.

At present, Centipede offers an array of features, such as a digital wallet, escrow services, token issuance, NFTs, and seamless XRP-to-XRP and token-to-token payment capabilities. Our team is currently working on enhancing Centipede's social aspects by incorporating functionalities like contacts, messaging, and video sharing, providing users with a personalized experience.

Furthermore, we are designing CBDC use cases that will be integrated into the system at a later stage. The XRP Ledger serves as the backbone of our entire platform, ensuring its robustness and reliability. We welcome and appreciate any feedback from the community.
